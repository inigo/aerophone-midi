# Aerophone MIDI

A Web MIDI application built with Vite and TypeScript for interfacing with MIDI devices.

## Usage

1. Connect your MIDI device to your computer
2. Open the application in a supported web browser
3. Grant MIDI access when prompted
4. Your connected MIDI devices will appear in the device list
5. MIDI messages from input devices will be displayed in real-time

## Browser Compatibility

This application requires a browser that supports the Web MIDI API (e.g. recent Chrome, Firefox - not Safari).

You may well need to connect the aerophone physically, rather than via Bluetooth.
